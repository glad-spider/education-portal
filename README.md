"education portal for students"
Build an online learning web application.

Short description
The web application should have 2 types of users: teachers and students. The goal of teachers is to publish courses. Courses consist of reading materials and tests. The goal of students is to enroll in courses and try to learn by going through every step of the course.

Glossary
Reading material - a page with a bunch of text that the student can read (the page can have headings, bold text, etc)

Test - a page with a bunch of questions. Every question can have one/multiple answers.

Pages
A list of pages that the web application should have (sorted by priority):

Login page
Signup page
Reset password page
Courses page (a list of all available courses)
Course page (a page with course description and details. On this page, the student can click on "Enroll" button and then start going through the course)
Classroom page (a page that shows all the courses that the student is working on)
Classroom course page (the student opens this page when he/she wants to work on the course. It shows the progress. What steps were already done. What's the current step the student is working on, etc)
Profile page
Teacher's dashboard (create/publish/edit/delete courses. These pages have the least priority. We can use admin panel for creating courses at the beginning)
